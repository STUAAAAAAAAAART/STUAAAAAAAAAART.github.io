# Converting a selection of nodes in the maya node editor to python commands

**Problem**: writing python code to codify a node network takes a long time due to:
- having to look up the same documentation for the same core command over and over again for each invocation (muscle memory still isn't there yet; also code paranoia and oversimulation in my head)
- increased effort as number of nodes increase

**Goal**: writing python code to write python code

**Considerations and Future Improvements**:
- nodes with complex attributes like `blendMatrix`
  - in manual service, a new `target` has to be made in the attribute editor panel before connecting an attribute to it
- attributes with pre-assigned values instead of an incoming connection, especially `composeMatrix` and other maths and utility nodes (e.g. quick linear scalars)
  - for pre-calculated transforms: it's best to address this after the code printing step
- complex nodes, especially IK solvers and constraints
	- very especially the `message` attribute, will have to skip those
- code adjustment friendliness
  - input nodes/objects are held by a python `list`, so that i can reorder or rename a few things without having to worry too much about program flow or find-and-replace-and-sanityCheck, a step towards a peace of mind
- printing the output to a file
  - currently copying off the script editor, but large networks could easily flood the console with lots of text

the next step after getting the printout, would be to adjust the lines where specific nodes would be retreived from a selection and not created

so selecting these and running the script:

will result in the following output, which is most of the legwork done (looks really daunting to type out by hand in hindsight...)
